# 3D Solar System 

## Overview

This project is a **3D simulation of the solar system** created using **Three.js**. It displays the Sun and all 8 planets orbiting it, with each planet rotating in real time. The simulation includes realistic lighting, orbital motion, and user controls to adjust planet speeds.

---

## Features

- Sun at the center  
- 8 planets orbiting with real-time animation  
- Speed control sliders for each planet  
- Realistic lighting and orbital motion  
- Mobile-responsive and works on all modern browsers  

---

## Controls

- Use the sliders on the top-left control panel to adjust the **orbital speed** of each planet.  
- Changes reflect in **real time**.  
- *(Bonus features like pause/resume, dark/light mode, and star background can be added if implemented)*  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Three.js** for 3D rendering  
- **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**  
- Optional: GSAP for animations (not required)

## How to Run Locally

1. Download or unzip the project folder.  
2. Open `index.html` in any **modern browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).  
3. The 3D simulation should load and run immediately.  
4. Use the sliders to control each planet's orbital speed.  

**No installations or servers required** – it runs in the browser.
